## What is it?

This is my first attempt at making Roguelike game with help from [TCOD tutorial](http://https://www.rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/ "TCOD") by user [TStand90](https://github.com/TStand90 "TStand90 on GitHub")

Also my first proper contact with OOP in Python and in general.
There will definitely be bad code practices and a lot of experimenting.

## TODOs | IDEAS
- Joining lone rooms in cave generator
- Another generator for dungeons Rogue style 
- Field of view
- Movable & destroyable entities
- Enemies
- Stats system
- Saving and loading
- Interface
- Inventory and items
